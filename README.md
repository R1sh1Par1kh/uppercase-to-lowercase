Hey users, this new repository was coded in python, and developed to convert uppercase/caps locked text to lowercase. To use it, run the program and input your text when ready ðŸ˜ƒ.

P.S. - Don't input lowercase unless you want the program to break - I have released the same code except everything is vice versa
